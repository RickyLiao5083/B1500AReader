# CVIVReader
This APP can fetch the C-V and I-V csv files.

Only C-V and I-V are accepted.

You can download the source code and customize it by yourself.

Note that this APP reads the csv from row 264 for the C-V files (voltage is column B and capacitance is column D), and from row 259 for the I-V files (voltage is column B and abs(I) is column D).
